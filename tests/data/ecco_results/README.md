## Selected ECCO results test data.

Although already included for test purposes, the selected ECCO results
data included here have been downloaded using the script,
`download_selected_data.sh`.

Note that the script defines a subset of data types to be downloaded,
as well as the number of available times for each (first three, by
default).
