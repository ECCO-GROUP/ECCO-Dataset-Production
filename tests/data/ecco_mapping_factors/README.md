## ECCO mapping factors test data.

Although already included for test purposes, the mapping factors in
this directory could also have been generated via:

- Download from AWS (ref. `download.sh`, which is the method used here)
- Generation using ECCO-Dataset-Production command-line utility,
  `edp_create_factors`
