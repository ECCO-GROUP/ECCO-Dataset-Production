ECCO Dataset Production
=======================

ECCO Dataset Production is a Python package and related tools that
support NASA's `Open Science
<https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/>`__ initiative by making the
`ECCO consortium's <https://ecco-group.org/>`__ multidecadel,
physically- and statistically-consistent ocean state estimates
available as self-documenting `NetCDF
<https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf>`__-formatted files.

It can be used on everything from small, locally-generated data
collections to cloud-based multi-terabyte datasets such as those
hosted by the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center
(`PO.DAAC <https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/>`__) and NASA's Earthdata
`ESDIS Project <https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/about/esdis>`__.

The following sections describe how to install, configure, and run the
ECCO Dataset Production toolset in both local and cloud compute modes.
