\section{GDS 2.0 Filenames and Supporting Conventions}

Striving to achieve a flexible naming convention that maintains consistency across processing levels
and better serves user needs, the GDS 2.0 uses a single form for all GHRSST data files. An overview
of the format is presented below in Section 7.1 along with example filenames. Details on each of the
filename convention components are provided in Sections 7.2 through 7.8.
\par
In addition, a best practice has been established for creating character strings used to describe
GHRSST SST products and sources of ancillary data. These strings, and associated numeric codes
for the SST products, are used within some GHRSST data files but are not part of the filename
convention itself. The best practice is described in Section 7.9.
\par

\subsection{1 Overview of Filename Convention and Example Filenames}
The filenaming convention for the GDS 2.0 is shown below. 
\par \vspace{0.25in}

\texttt{<Indicative Date><Indicative Time>-<RDAC>-<Processing Level>\_GHRSST-<SST Type>-
<Product String>-<Additional Segregator>-v<GDS Version>-fv<File Version>.<File Type>}
\par \vspace{0.25in}

The variable components within braces (“< >”) are summarized in Table 7-1 below and detailed in the
\textbf{should not} be used in any GHRSST code or the <Additional Segregator> element. Example
filenames are given later in this section. While no strict limit to filename length is mandated, RDACs
are encouraged to keep the length to less than 240 characters to increase readability and usability.

<Indicative Date> & YYYYMMDD & The identifying date for this data set. See Section 7.2. \\ \hline
<Indicative Time> & HHMMSS & The identifying time for this data set. The time used is dependent on the <Processing Level> of
the data set: L2P: start time of granule 
\begin{itemize}
 \item{L3U: start time of granule}
 \item{L3C and L3S: centre time of the collation window}
 \item{L4 and GMPE: nominal time of analysis}
\end{itemize}
All times should be given in UTC. See Section 7.3. \\ \hline
<RDAC> & The RDAC where the file was created & The Regional Data Assembly Centre (RDAC)code, listed in Section 7.4. \\ \hline
<Processing Level> & The data processing level code (L2P, L3U, L3C, L3S, or L4) & 
The data processing level code, defined in Section 7.5. \\ \hline
<SST Type> & The type of SST data included in the file. & 
Conforms to the GHRSST definitions for SST, defined in Section 7.6 \\ \hline

<Product String> &
A character string identifying the
SST product set. The string is
used uniquely within an RDAC
but may be shared across
RDACs. & 
The unique “name” within an RDAC of the
product line. See Section 7.7 for the product
string lists, one each for L2P, L3, L4, and GMPE
products. See Section 7.7. \\ \hline

<Additional Segregator> &
Optional text to distinguish
between files with the same
<Product String>. Dashes are
not allowed within this element. &
This text is used since the other filename
components are sometimes insufficient to
uniquely identify a file. For example, in L2P or
L3U (un-collated) products this is often the
original file name or processing algorithm. Note,
underscores should be used, not dashes. For L4
files, this element should begin with the
appropriate regional code as defined in Section 7.8. This component is optional but must be used
in those cases were non-unique filenames would otherwise result. \\ \hline

<GDS Version> & nn.n & Version number of the GDS used to process the file. For example, GDS 2.0 = “02.0”. \\ \hline
<File Version> & xx.x & Version number for the file, for example, “01.0”. \\ \hline

<File Type> & netCDF data file suffix (nc) or ISO metadata file suffix (xml) & 
Indicates this is a netCDF file containing data or its corresponding ISO-19115 metadata record in XML.\\ \hline

\subsection{<Processing Level>}
Satellite data processing level definitions can lead to ambiguous situations, especially regarding the
distinction between L3 and L4 products. GHRSST identified the use of analysis procedures to fill gaps
where no observations exist to resolve this ambiguity. Within GHRSST filenames, the <Processing
Level> codes are shown below in Table 7-3. GHRSST currently establishes standards for L2P, L3U,
L3C, L3S, and L4 (GHRSST Multi-Product Ensembles known as GMPE are a special kind of L4
product for which GHRSST also provides standards). \par

\begin{tabular}{|p{0.1\textwidth}|p{0.15\textwidth}|p{0.75\textwidth}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{lightgray}
\textbf{Level} & \textbf{<Processing Level> Code} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline

Level 0 & L0 &
Unprocessed instrument and payload data at full resolution. GHRSST
does not make recommendations regarding formats or content for data
at this processing level. \\ \hline

Level 1A & L1A & 
Reconstructed unprocessed instrument data at full resolution, time
referenced, and annotated with ancillary information, including
radiometric and geometric calibration coefficients and geo-referencing
parameters, computed and appended, but not applied, to L0 data.
GHRSST does not make recommendations regarding formats or
content for data at this processing level. \\ \hline

Level 1B & L1B & 
Level 1A data that have been processed to sensor units. GHRSST
does not currently make recommendations regarding formats or content
for L1B data. \\ \hline

Level 2 & Preprocessed L2P &
Geophysical variables derived from Level 1 source data at the same
resolution and location as the Level 1 data, typically in a satellite
projection with geographic information. These data form the
fundamental basis for higher-level GHRSST products and require
ancillary data and uncertainty estimates. \\ \hline

Level 3 & L3U L3C L3S & Level 2 variables mapped on a defined grid with reduced requirements for ancillary data. 
Uncertainty estimates are still mandatory. Three
types of L3 products are defined:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Un-collated (L3U): L2 data granules remapped to a space grid without combining any observations from overlapping orbits}
\item {Collated (L3C): observations combined from a single instrument into a space-time grid}
\item {Super-collated (L3S): observations combined from multiple instruments into a space-time grid.}
\end{itemize}
Note that L3 GHRSST products do not use analysis or interpolation
procedures to fill gaps where no observations are available. \\ \hline

Level 4 & L4 &
Data sets created from the analysis of lower level data that result in
gridded, gap-free products. SST data generated from multiple sources
of satellite data using optimal interpolation are an example of L4
GHRSST products. GMPE products are a type of L4 dataset. \\  \hline

Note that within GHRSST, all L2P files require a full set of extensive ancillary data such as wind
speeds and times of observation that are provided as \'dynamic flags\' that users can manipulate to
filter data according to their own quality criteria. L2P files form the basis of higher-level products and
are often the best level products for data assimilation. The requirement for dynamic flags is particularly
important in this context. Higher-level L3 products are often intended for general use or created for
input to Level 4 analysis systems so the requirement for extensive ancillary data is reduced. Since
some GHRSST RDACs only process data natively on grids (especially in the case of geostationary
platform observations), the GDS 2.0 L3 specification is flexible enough to allow for the creation of L3
files which meet all the content requirements of a L2P file. In all L2P and L3 cases, bias and standard
deviation uncertainty estimates are mandatory. \par

The distinction between L3 GHRSST and L4 GHRSST data is made primarily on whether or not any
gap-filling techniques are employed, not on whether data from multiple instruments is used in the L3
product. If no gap filling procedure (such as optimal interpolation) is used, then the product remains a
L3 GHRSST product. GHRSST defines three kinds of L3 files: un-collated (L3U), collated (L3C), and
super-collated (L3S). If gap filling is used to fill all observations gaps, then the resulting gap-free data
are considered L4 GHRSST data products. \par

% \subsection{<SST Type>}
% In conjunction with the NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) community [AD-9] the GHRSST Science
% Team agreed on the CF standard names for “SST” shown in the following figure and described in
% more detail below. The names were first included in CF-1.3, and the current version (CF-1.4) of the
% standard name table that can be found in [AD-8]. In addition, the GHRSST Science Team agreed to
% use the CF Naming Convention [AD-3] for variable names that do not already exist as part of the CF
% Convention. CF definitions are used in the GDS and across GHRSST and are shown schematically in
% Figure 7-1. The different kinds of SST are detailed later in this section and the relevant <SST Type>
% codes to be used in the filenames are provided. \par \vspace{1in}

% % Figure 7-1. Overview of SST measurement types used within GHRSST
% \begin{figure}[h]
%     \caption{Overview of SST measurment types used within GHRSST}
%     \label{fig:Overview of SST measurment types used within GHRSST}
% \end{figure}
% \textbf{Figure 7-1. Overview of SST measurement types used within GHRSST.} \par
% CF Definition: \emph{sea\_surface\_temperature is usually abbreviated as "SST". It is the temperature of sea
% water near the surface (including the part under sea-ice, if any), and not the interface temperature,
% whose standard name is surface\_temperature. For the temperature of sea water at a particular depth
% or layer, a data variable of sea\_water\_temperature with a vertical coordinate axis should be used.} \par
% Additional Details: The sea surface skin temperature (SSTskin) as defined above represents the
% actual temperature of the water across a very small depth of approximately 20 micrometers. This
% definition is chosen for consistency with the majority of infrared satellite and ship mounted radiometer
% measurements. \par

% \textbf{Sea\_surface\_subskin\_temperature (GHRSST <SST Type>: SSTsubskin):}\par
% CF Definition: \emph{The surface called "surface" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. The sea
% surface subskin temperature is the temperature at the base of the conductive laminar sub-layer of the
% ocean surface, that is, at a depth of approximately 1 - 1.5 millimetres below the air-sea interface. For
% practical purposes, this quantity can be well approximated to the measurement of surface temperature
% by a microwave radiometer operating in the 6 - 11 gigahertz frequency range, but the relationship is
% neither direct nor invariant to changing physical conditions or to the specific geometry of the
% microwave measurements. Measurements of this quantity are subject to a large potential diurnal cycle
% due to thermal stratification of the upper ocean layer in low wind speed high solar irradiance
% conditions.}\par
% Additional Details: The sea surface subskin temperature (SSTsubskin) represents the temperature at
% the base of the thermal skin layer. The difference between SSTint and SSTsubskin is related to the
% net flux of heat through the thermal skin layer. SSTsubskin is the temperature of a layer approximately
% 1 mm thick at the ocean surface.\par

% \textbf{Sea\_water\_temperature (GHRSST <SST Type>: SSTdepth or SSTz):}\par
% CF Definition: \emph{The general term, "bulk" sea surface temperature, has the standard name
% sea\_surface\_temperature with no associated vertical coordinate axis. The temperature of sea water at
% a particular depth (other than the foundation level) should be reported using the standard name
% sea\_water\_temperature and, wherever possible, supplying a vertical coordinate axis or scalar
% coordinate variable.}\par
% Additional Details: Sea water temperature (SSTdepth or SSTz, for example SST1.5m) is the terminology
% adopted by GHRSST to represent in situ measurements near the surface of the ocean that have
% traditionally been reported simply as SST or "bulk" SST. For example SST6m would refer to an SST
% measurement made at a depth of 6 m. Without a clear statement of the precise depth at which the
% SST measurement was made, and the circumstances surrounding the measurement, such a sample
% lacks the information needed for comparison with, or validation of satellite-derived estimates of SST
% using other data sources. The terminology has been introduced to encourage the reporting of depth
% (z) along with the temperature.\par
% All measurements of water temperature beneath the SSTsubskin are obtained from a wide variety of
% sensors such as drifting buoys having single temperature sensors attached to their hull, moored buoys
% that sometimes include deep thermistor chains at depths ranging from a few meters to a few thousand
% meters, thermosalinograph (TSG) systems aboard ships recording at a fixed depth while the vessel is 
% underway, Conductivity Temperature and Depth (CTD) systems providing detailed vertical profiles of
% the thermohaline structure used during hydrographic surveys and to considerable depths of several
% thousand meters, and various expendable bathythermograph systems (XBT). In all cases, these
% temperature observations are distinct from those obtained using remote sensing techniques and
% measurements at a given depth should be referred to as sea\_water\_temperature qualified by a depth
% in meters rather than sea surface temperatures. The situation is complicated further when one
% considers ocean model outputs for which the SST may be the mean SST over a layer of the ocean
% several tens of meters thick.\par

% \textbf{Sea\_surface\_foundation\_temperature (GHRSST <SST Type>: SSTfnd):}\par
% CF Definition: \emph{The surface called "surface" means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. The sea
% surface foundation temperature is the water temperature that is not influenced by a thermally stratified
% layer of diurnal temperature variability (either by daytime warming or nocturnal cooling). The
% foundation temperature is named to indicate that it is the temperature from which the growth of the
% diurnal thermocline develops each day, noting that on some occasions with a deep mixed layer there
% is no clear foundation temperature in the surface layer. In general, sea surface foundation temperature
% will be similar to a night-time minimum or pre-dawn value at depths of between approximately 1 and 5
% meters. In the absence of any diurnal signal, the foundation temperature is considered equivalent to
% the quantity with standard name sea\_surface\_subskin\_temperature. The sea surface foundation
% temperature defines a level in the upper water column that varies in depth, space, and time depending
% on the local balance between thermal stratification and turbulent energy and is expected to change
% slowly over the course of a day. If possible, a data variable with the standard name
% sea\_surface\_foundation\_temperature should be used with a scalar vertical coordinate variable to
% specify the depth of the foundation level. Sea surface foundation temperature is measured at the base
% of the diurnal thermocline or as close to the water surface as possible in the absence of thermal
% stratification. Only in situ contact thermometry is able to measure the sea surface foundation
% temperature. Analysis procedures must be used to estimate sea surface foundation temperature value
% from radiometric satellite measurements of the quantities with standard names
% sea\_surface\_skin\_temperature and sea\_surface\_subskin\_temperature. Sea surface foundation
% temperature provides a connection with the historical concept of a "bulk" sea surface temperature
% considered representative of the oceanic mixed layer temperature that is typically represented by any
% sea temperature measurement within the upper ocean over a depth range of 1 to approximately 20
% meters. The general term, "bulk" sea surface temperature, has the standard name
% sea\_surface\_temperature with no associated vertical coordinate axis. Sea surface foundation
% temperature provides a more precise, well-defined quantity than "bulk" sea surface temperature and,
% consequently, is more representative of the mixed layer temperature. The temperature of sea water at
% a particular depth (other than the foundation level) should be reported using the standard name
% sea\_water\_temperature and, wherever possible, supplying a vertical coordinate axis or scalar
% coordinate variable.}\par
% Additional Details: Through the definition of the CF standard names, GHRSST is attempting to
% discourage the use of the term “bulk SST”, replacing it instead with sea\_water\_temperature
% (SSTdepth) and a depth coordinate, or sea\_surface\_foundation\_temperature (SSTfnd) and a depth
% coordinate if possible, if the observation comes from the base of the diurnal thermocline.\par

% \textbf{Blended SST (GHRSST <SST Type>: SSTblend):}\par
% In addition to the CF standard names defined above, GHRSST also uses the term “Blended SST” for
% ambiguous cases when the depth or type of SST is not well known. This ambiguity in depth may arise
% in some L4 analysis products that merge multiple types of SST from satellite and in situ observations.
% Note, however, that many L4 analysis systems do attempt to specifically create a sea surface
% foundation temperature, SSTfnd.\par
% The SST codes and CF standard names defined above and used within GHRSST are summarized
% along with their key characteristics in Table 7-4.\par
