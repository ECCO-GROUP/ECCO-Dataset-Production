1. Create a file called .netrc in your home directory (linux, Mac):
    /home/<username>/.netrc
or _netrc (Windows):
    C:\Users\<username>\_netrc
    

2. The netrc file must have the following structure and must include your Earthdata account login name and password:
    machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov
        login <your username>
        password <your password>


3. Set permissions on your netrc file to be readable only by the current user. If not, you will receive the error "netrc access too permissive."
    $ chmod 0600 ~/.netrc

4.  Create an urs_cookies "cookie" file. This will be used to persist sessions across individual wget calls, making it more efficient.
  > cd ~
  > touch .urs_cookies
